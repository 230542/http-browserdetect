DESCRIPTION

    The HTTP::BrowserDetect object does a number of tests on an HTTP user
    agent string. The results of these tests are available via methods of
    the object.

    This module was originally based upon the JavaScript browser detection
    code available at
    http://www.mozilla.org/docs/web-developer/sniffer/browser_type.html.

CONSTRUCTOR AND STARTUP

 new()

        HTTP::BrowserDetect->new( $user_agent_string )

    The constructor may be called with a user agent string specified.
    Otherwise, it will use the value specified by $ENV{'HTTP_USER_AGENT'},
    which is set by the web server when calling a CGI script.

SUBROUTINES/METHODS

Browser Information

 browser_string()

    Returns the name of the browser from among the following values:

    Netscape, Firefox, Safari, Chrome, MSIE, WebTV, AOL Browser, Opera,
    Mosaic, Lynx, Links, ELinks, RealPlayer, IceWeasel, curl, puf,
    NetFront, Mobile Safari, BlackBerry, Obigo, Nintendo DSi, Nintendo 3DS,
    StarOffice, Lotus Notes, iCab, BrowseX, Silk.

    If the browser could not be recognized, returns undef.

Browser Version

    Please note that that the version(), major() and minor() methods have
    been deprecated as of release 1.78 of this module. They should be
    replaced with public_version(), public_major(), public_minor(), and
    public_beta().

    The reasoning behind this is that version() method will, in the case of
    Safari, return the Safari/XXX numbers even when Version/XXX numbers are
    present in the UserAgent string (i.e. it will return incorrect versions
    for Safari in some cases).

 public_version()

    Returns the browser version (major and minor) as a string.

 public_major()

    Returns the major part of the version as a string. For example, for
    Chrome 36.0.1985.67, this returns "36".

    Returns undef if no version information can be detected.

 public_minor()

    Returns the minor part of the version as a string. This includes the
    decimal point; for example, for Chrome 36.0.1985.67, this returns ".0".

    Returns undef if no version information can be detected.

 public_beta()

    Returns any part of the version after the major and minor version, as a
    string. For example, for Chrome 36.0.1985.67, this returns ".1985.67".
    The beta part of the string can contain any type of alphanumeric
    characters.

    Returns undef if no version information can be detected. Returns an
    empty string if version information is detected but it contains only a
    major and minor version with nothing following.

 os_string()

    Returns one of the following strings, or undef.

      Win95, Win98, WinME, WinNT, Win2K, WinXP, Win2k3, WinVista, Win7, Win8,
      Win8.1, Windows Phone, Mac, Mac OS X, iOS, Win3x, OS2, Unix, VMS, Linux,
      Chrome OS, Firefox OS, Playstation 3 GameOS, Playstation Portable GameOS,
      RIM Tablet OS, BlackBerry 10

Browser Properties

 browser_properties()

    Returns a list of the browser properties. Operating systems, devices,
    browser names, and general tests (e.g. "mobile" and "robot") are all
    browser properties.

    The methods listed below are all browser properties (in addition to
    being methods).

General tests

 mobile()

    Returns true if the browser appears to belong to a handheld device.

 tablet()

    Returns true if the browser appears to belong to a tablet device.

 robot()

    Returns true if the user agent appears to be a robot, spider, crawler,
    or other automated Web client.

  lib()

    Returns true if the user agent appears to be a software library (e.g.
    LWP, curl, wget). Generally this also implies that robot() will return
    true.

OS Platform and Version

    The following methods are available, each returning a true or false
    value. Some methods also test for the operating system version. The
    indentations below show the hierarchy of tests (for example, win2k is
    considered a type of winnt, which is a type of win32)

 windows()

        win16 win3x win31
        win32
            winme win95 win98
            winnt
                win2k winxp win2k3 winvista win7
                win8
                    win8_0 win8_1
        wince
        winphone
            winphone7 winphone7_5 winphone8

 dotnet()

 chromeos()

 firefoxos()

 mac()

    mac68k macppc macosx ios

 os2()

 bb10()

 rimtabletos()

 unix()

      sun sun4 sun5 suni86 irix irix5 irix6 hpux hpux9 hpux10
      aix aix1 aix2 aix3 aix4 linux sco unixware mpras reliant
      dec sinix freebsd bsd

 vms()

 amiga()

 ps3gameos()

 pspgameos()

    It may not be possibile to detect Win98 in Netscape 4.x and earlier. On
    Opera 3.0, the userAgent string includes "Windows 95/NT4" on all Win32,
    so you can't distinguish between Win95 and WinNT.

Detecting Browser Vendor

    The following methods are available, each returning a true or false
    value. Some methods also test for the browser version, saving you from
    checking the version separately.

  aol aol3 aol4 aol5 aol6

  chrome

  emacs

  firefox

  gecko

  icab

  ie ie3 ie4 ie4up ie5 ie5up ie55 ie55up ie6 ie7 ie8 ie9 ie10 ie11

  ie_compat_mode

    The ie_compat_mode is used to determine if the IE user agent is for the
    compatibility mode view, in which case the real version of IE is higher
    than that detected. The true version of IE can be inferred from the
    version of Trident in the engine_version method.

  konqueror

  lotusnotes

  lynx links elinks

  mobile_safari

  mosaic

  mozilla

  neoplanet neoplanet2

  netfront

  netscape nav2 nav3 nav4 nav4up nav45 nav45up navgold nav6 nav6up

  opera opera3 opera4 opera5 opera6 opera7

  realplayer

    The realplayer method above tests for the presence of either the
    RealPlayer plug-in "(r1 " or the browser "RealPlayer".

  realplayer_browser

    The realplayer_browser method tests for the presence of the RealPlayer
    browser (but returns 0 for the plugin).

  safari

  staroffice

  webtv

    Netscape 6, even though its called six, in the User-Agent string has
    version number 5. The nav6 and nav6up methods correctly handle this
    quirk. The Firefox test correctly detects the older-named versions of
    the browser (Phoenix, Firebird).

Detecting Devices

    The following methods are available, each returning a true or false
    value.

  android

  audrey

  avantgo

  blackberry

  dsi

  iopener

  iphone

  ipod

  ipad

  kindle

  n3ds

  obigo

  palm

  webos

  wap

  psp

    or false value. This is by no means a complete list of robots that
    exist on the Web.

  ahrefs

  altavista

  askjeeves

  baidu

  curl

  facebook

  getright

  google

Other information

 user_agent()

    Returns the value of the user agent string.

    Calling this method with a parameter has now been deprecated and this
    feature will be removed in an upcoming release.

 country()

    Returns the country string as it may be found in the user agent string.
    This will be in the form of an upper case 2 character code. ie: US, DE,
    etc

 language()

    Returns the language string as it is found in the user agent string.
    This will be in the form of an upper case 2 character code. ie: EN, DE,
    etc

 device()

    Returns the method name of the actual hardware, if it can be detected.
    Currently returns one of: android, audrey, avantgo, blackberry, dsi,
    iopener, ipad, iphone, ipod, kindle, n3ds, palm, ps3, psp, wap, webos.
    Returns undef if no hardware can be detected

 device_name()

    Returns a human formatted version of the hardware device name. These
    names are subject to change and are really meant for display purposes.
    You should use the device() method in your logic. Returns one of:
    Android, Audrey, BlackBerry, Nintendo DSi, iopener, iPad, iPhone, iPod,
    Amazon Kindle, Nintendo 3DS, Palm, Sony PlayStation 3, Sony Playstation
    Portable, WAP capable phone, webOS. Also Windows-based smartphones will
    output various different names like HTC T7575. Returns undef if this is
    not a device or if no device name can be detected.

 version($version)

    This is probably not what you want. Please use either public_version()
    or engine_version() instead.

    Returns the version as a string. If passed a parameter, returns true if
    it equals the browser major version.

    This function returns wrong values for some Safari versions, for
    compatibility with earlier code. public_version() returns correct
    version numbers for Safari.

 major($major)

    This is probably not what you want. Please use either public_major() or
    engine_major() instead.

    Returns the integer portion of the browser version as a string. If
    passed a parameter, returns true if it equals the browser major
    version.

    This function returns wrong values for some Safari versions, for
    compatibility with earlier code. public_version() returns correct
    version numbers for Safari.

 minor($minor)

    This is probably not what you want. Please use either public_minor() or
    engine_minor() instead.

    Returns the decimal portion of the browser version as a string.

    If passed a parameter, returns true if equals the minor version.

    This function returns wrong values for some Safari versions, for
    compatibility with earlier code. public_version() returns correct
    version numbers for Safari.

 beta($beta)

    This is probably not what you want. Please use public_beta() instead.

    Returns the beta version, consisting of any characters after the major
    and minor version number, as a string.

    This function returns wrong values for some Safari versions, for
    compatibility with earlier code. public_version() returns correct
    version numbers for Safari.

 engine_string()

    Returns the name of the rendering engine, one of the following:

    Gecko, WebKit, KHTML, Trident, MSIE, Presto, NetFront

    Note that this returns "WebKit" for webkit based browsers (including
    the Blink fork). This is a change from previous versions of this
    library, which returned "KHTML" for webkit.

    Returns undef otherwise.

 engine_version()

    Returns the version number of the rendering engine, major and minor, as
    a string.

 engine_major()

    Returns the major version number of the rendering engine.

 engine_minor()

    Returns the minor version number of the rendering engine.

 gecko_version()

    If a Gecko rendering engine is used (as in Mozilla or Firefox), returns
    the engine version. If no Gecko browser is being used, or the version
    number can't be detected, returns undef.

    This is an old function, preserved for compatibility.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

    The biggest limitation at this point is the test suite, which really
    needs to have many more UserAgent strings to test against.

CONTRIBUTING

    Patches are certainly welcome, with many thanks for the excellent
    contributions which have already been received. The preferred method of
    patching would be to fork the GitHub repo and then send me a pull
    request, but plain old patch files are also welcome.

    If you're able to add test cases, this will speed up the time to
    release your changes. Just edit t/useragents.json so that the test
    coverage includes any changes you have made. Please contact me if you
    have any questions.

    This distribution uses Dist::Zilla. If you're not familiar with this
    module, please see
